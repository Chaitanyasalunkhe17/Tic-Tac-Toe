The Tic-Tac-Toe Game project is an advanced and innovative take on the classic game, developed using Java in the NetBeans Apache IDE. This version not only preserves the traditional 3x3 grid gameplay but introduces a unique feature that sets it apart: after every three moves, players are required to move their character to a new position before continuing, adding a strategic layer to the game that challenges players to think ahead and adapt their strategies.
